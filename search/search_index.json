If you didn\u2019t know, we were paying up to $50/mo for our new site/forums, so\u2026 We\u2019re looking at our options.

So what do we mean by scaling down? We\u2019ll remove the forum and delete your accounts. And you won\u2019t be able to log in anymore; next there's scaling down and switching the forums to an open-source one, meaning we can use whatever provider we want and can host for much cheaper, dropping our cost down to $29/mo. And then there\u2019s the last point. Make a whole new site and forum, and there\u2019s a massive problem with that: we don\u2019t know HTML. The reason we\u2019re paying so much is we made that site with a website builder, meaning we have to put up with the price they give us; we can\u2019t just export the site and host it ourselves. And if you're wondering, yes, we\u2019ve looked for open-source ones, and all of them were painstakingly unintuitive or cost too much. We left out WordPress, which is PHP and a pain to get running on bare metal, a.k.a. our own hardware, and it just sucks because we are sick of paying so much.</p>"},{"location":"Hub/Transparency%20Reports/Community/1-23-25/#donations","title":"Donations?","text":"<p>TBH, we have been running back and forth on the idea of having the ability to donate to us via Liberapay, but we never had set it up because we were debating if we wanted to, but I guess if people really want to chip in and give us a hand, I guess we can; we will make an announcement if we do so.</p>"},{"location":"Hub/Transparency%20Reports/Community/1-23-25/#thats-it","title":"That's it!","text":"<p>This is our first-ever transparency report.
